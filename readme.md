SUMMARY: In this lesson, I got a chance to practice using querySelector again and also learned about using time and transforming elements in response to the current time. One other cool thing was using cubic-bezier, which led me to do a little research on cubic Bezier curves and easing functions. Pretty interesting how that can be used to make our animations look more polished!
